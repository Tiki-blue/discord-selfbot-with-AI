# Self botting with local AI

A Discord bot that responds with a **custom prompt** and maintains **user conversation history** using **Ollama** for AI-generated replies.

---

##  Features

The bot automatically responds when users:

- Mention it via `@botname`
- Reply to its messages
- Send it direct messages (DMs)

Remembers previous conversations for better context.  
Each user has their **own persistent conversation history**.
